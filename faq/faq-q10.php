			<p>While we respect the inhabitants of every wormhole, it is not always possible to 
				contact them prior to or after leaving a rescue cache or conducting a search for 
				or in their system. The resources we leave behind do not provide any actionable 
				intel nor do we share information about our travels with any third parties. 
				Additionally, our pilots are instructed to avoid placing rescue caches within 
				d-scan range of POSes or Citadels whenever possible. However, New Eden is a 
				dangerous place and we cannot guarantee that our resources will not be tampered 
				with. As in all scenarios, use caution when approaching a rescue cache!</p>
