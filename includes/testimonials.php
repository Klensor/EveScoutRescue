        	I could not reconnect to my probes. I spotted a can that said something about 
        	"EvE-Scout"... I thought it could be a trap -- this is EVE after all.<br /><br />
			I got in touch with friendly people in the chat, got directions for how to locate 
			the can, and got the probes. It felt almost unbelievable. Like a lifebuoy being 
			thrown out to a person at sea.<br /><br />
			It was a really cool experience and yet another thing that makes EVE a very special 
			game.<br /><br />

        	I was stranded inside a wormhole. I asked for help on my corp channel and they told 
        	me about a rescue corp.	I didn't believe that. I thought they were trying to kill 
        	me, but I had nothing to lose. I was stranded anyway, with self-destruct my last 
        	option, so I decided to speak with EvE-Scout Rescue. They helped me really fast 
        	and without obligation,	so I refilled the rescue cache as a way to say thanks. I 
        	was in high sec in no more than 15 minutes.<br /><br />
        	Thanks, EvE-Scout Rescue. I really apreciate it.<br /><br />

        	Thank you very much for rescuing me from a C5 deep in WH space. After I heard 
        	from EvE-Scout, I was not believing the stories I was told, but I can now say 
        	that everything was right. I contacted you guys and 2 days later I was safe in 
        	high sec once again, without any obligations or anything else. Almost too good 
        	to be real.<br /><br />
        	It was professional, fast and a very nice contact which is why we play this game. 
			Thank you again. <br /><br />

        	I was stranded in a wormhole I was exploring and was destroyed as I 
        	entered the system. The rescue pilot contacted me asking if I was 
        	in distress and I confirmed as such. The pilot walked me through 
        	the steps and was very patient with me as well since I am very new 
        	to the game. I am grateful to the EvE-Scout Rescue Search 
        	and Rescue Division. I would recommend that everyone join their channel.<br /><br />

        	I appreciate the work you guys did, as there was not only excellent work 
        	by the person in the chat channel, but also by the person who had installed 
        	the cache in that particular wormhole to try and get me out.<br /><br />
			Even though you guys didn't get me out, you did spectacular work considering 
			how badly I had gotten myself stuck.<br /><br />

        	I used your [SAR] service, and what can I say? - I was pretty amazed, 
        	because, you know, EVE is a game where one trusts no one. I heard of 
        	you guys long ago, but never thought I'd need this kind of help. I 
        	gave it a try, and it worked pretty well for me. I'd give [the rescue

            I have to admit I was very skeptical when I first read about EvE-Scout. 
            I decided that even if it was legit, I probably would never need it. 
            It turns out that a week later I logged into my alt that was camping 
            [a wormhole] and realized I had forgotten to retrieve my probes during the 
            previous session. :-| You know the rest of the story.<br /><br />
			Thanks for the rescue. The service you provided was courteous, 
			business-like, and timely.<br /><br />

            I had doubts about Signal Cartel when I first stumbled upon their rescue cache, 
            but I contacted them anyway. The cache got me out of the hole that confined me for 
            over a year because of stupid mistakes that I made.<br /><br />
            If I happen to get lost in a hole again, and find myself with a rescue cache, 
            I'd not hesitate to contact them again. They are the only ones other than my corp, 
            alliance, or friends that I trust with my life in a game where everyone is out to 
            get you. I highly recommend them.<br /><br />
