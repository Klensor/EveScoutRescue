        	My exit hole closed, I forgot probes, can't reconnect to them, d-scan won't pick

        	I joined the EvE-Scout channel and contacted random Signal Cartel member. This 
        	cool saviour dude teaches me how to find the cache, I pick up probes, find exit 
        	to low sec, bookmark it, come back to the cache to replace the probes, and thank

        	I recently got stuck in a wormhole and lost my scanner probes to a disconnect. 
        	I contacted them via the in-game channel and immediately people responded with 
        	help offers. One person guided me to the rescue cache with the help of D-Scan. 
        	I got some Scanner Probes and fireworks out of the cache. Soon I could finally make my 
        	escape.<br /><br />
			After experiencing their help and reading up on the alliance Credo I immediatly 
			filled out the application form because I felt that this is what I want to do 
			while playing EvE. Now I'm a proud member of Signal Cartel and EvE-Scout and 
			do Bob's work.<br /><br />

            I have to admit I was very skeptical when I first read about EvE-Scout. 
            I decided that even if it was legit, I probably would never need it. 
            It turns out that a week later I logged into my alt that was camping 
            [a wormhole] and realized I had forgotten to retrieve my probes during the 
            previous session. :-| You know the rest of the story.<br /><br />

            I had doubts about Signal Cartel when I first stumbled upon their rescue cache, 
            but I contacted them anyway. The cache got me out of the hole that confined me for 
            over a year because of stupid mistakes that I made.<br /><br />
            If I happen to get lost in a hole again, and find myself with a rescue cache, 
            I'd not hesitate to contact them again. They are the only ones other than my corp, 
            alliance, or friends that I trust with my life in a game where everyone is out to 
            get you. I highly recommend them.<br /><br />
