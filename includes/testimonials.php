        	The service was both easy and quick, and got me out of quite a pickle.
        	I expect this service will be used well by others in need.<br /><br />

            I have to admit I was very skeptical when I first read about EvE-Scout. 
            I decided that even if it was legit, I probably would never need it. 
            It turns out that a week later I logged into my alt that was camping 
            [a wormhole] and realized I had forgotten to retrieve my probes during the 
            previous session. :-| You know the rest of the story.<br /><br />
			Thanks for the rescue. The service you provided was courteous, 
			business-like, and timely.<br /><br />

            I had doubts about Signal Cartel when I first stumbled upon their rescue cache, 
            but I contacted them anyway. The cache got me out of the hole that confined me for 
            over a year because of stupid mistakes that I made.<br /><br />
            If I happen to get lost in a hole again, and find myself with a rescue cache, 
            I'd not hesitate to contact them again. They are the only ones other than my corp, 
            alliance, or friends that I trust with my life in a game where everyone is out to 
            get you. I highly recommend them.<br /><br />
