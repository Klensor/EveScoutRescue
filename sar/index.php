						<p>The EvE-Scout Search and Rescue (SAR) program is one arm of our EvE-Scout Rescue (ESR) division. In situations where no rescue cache or rescue frigate is present, or where those options do not provide any help to the stranded pilot, our SAR program strives to facilitate a live rescue by one of our scouts. This service is offered to all pilots, regardless of alliance, sovereignty, or play style.</p>

						<p>We do not charge any fee for our search and rescue service, and our pilots will never solicit payment from you. However, while no payment is required, a tip is always appreciated! The amount of this gratuity, if anything, is completely up to you to determine.</p>

						<p>While our SAR pilots will do their very best to locate the wormhole system where you are stranded, we cannot offer any guarantees as to when or even if we will be able to locate you and effect a rescue. Due to the constant flux of wormhole connections, there is no way to be sure we will locate an entrance to your system in a timely fashion.</p>
						<p>Please also note that SAR does <strong>not</strong>* conduct searches for specific wormholes, due to the Signal Cartel <a href="http://www.eve-scout.com/signal-cartel/">Credo</a>'s requirement of maintaining neutrality.</p>
						<p class="small">*On occasion, we get a request to help a pilot find their way back into a wormhole where they have a POS or Citadel anchored. In such situations, and on a case by case basis, we may decide to perform this wormhole search. We will likely require proof of ownership (e.g., screenshots of the assets in question listed in the Corporation panel and emailed from the corporation’s CEO). In all such cases, prior approval of alliance and/or corp leadership is required before we begin the wormhole search. Contact <a href="https://gate.eveonline.com/Profile/Thrice%20Hapus">Thrice Hapus</a> to discuss further.</p>

						<p>The pilots of <a href="http://www.eve-scout.com/signal-cartel/">Signal Cartel</a>, the core corporation of the <a href="https://gate.eveonline.com/Alliance/EvE-Scout%20Enclave">EvE-Scout Enclave</a> alliance, abide by a strict Credo that emphasizes service to the capsuleer community of New Eden, respect to all regardless of affiliation or play style, non-aggression, friendship, kindness, and grace under pressure.</p>
						<p>Within Signal Cartel, each pilot is encouraged to participate in and invent ways to embody all that the Credo envisions. The Search and Rescue program is merely one of the myriad ways our pilots strive to live up to that high calling.</p>
						<p>There are many reasons capsuleers fly in New Eden: glory, fame, riches. Our pilots do so to be a part of one of the greatest stories of our time. We derive our glory, fame, and personal reward from the magnificent narrative tapestry we are weaving together. One of our favorite corporate pastimes is sharing with one another stories of successful rescues that occur as the result of our various rescue programs. We are grateful to you for granting us this unique opportunity!</p>
