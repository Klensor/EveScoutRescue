						<p>The EvE-Scout Rescue Frigate (RF) program, an outgrowth of the long-standing <a href="../esrc/">rescue cache</a> service, provides a basic emergency T1 scanning frigate for capsuleers stranded in wormholes, regardless of alliance, sovereignty, or play style.</p>
						<p>RF is only one facet of the EvE-Scout Rescue division, a dedicated group of Signal Cartel pilots who have answered to call of service to the greater New Eden community. As well as being a service to the EVE community, this program provides Signal Cartel members an opportunity to expand their exploration experiences, wormhole lifestyle, and game play content, as well as being an opportunity to earn a small, steady stream of ISK.</p>

					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>A rescue frigate is designed to be a stripped down vessel, usually a Venture, anchored somewhere in a wormhole that is capable of little beyond scanning down an exit from the wormhole where you are stranded. In alignment with our Credo, it is <em>not</em> fit with any weapons and has minimal defensive capability. It is fitted only with one (1) core probe launcher, eight (8) core scanner probes, and, optionally, modules that enhance scan strength and/or make the frigate harder to scan down. (Oh, and usually a few "hugs" [fireworks, snowballs] or other trinkets for fun!)</p>
						<p>When a capsuleer is stranded and in need, they can contact a Signal Cartel scout in the public EvE-Scout channel for assistance. If the fit of the frigate meets the stranded capsuleer's need, the scout will look up the rescue frigate's location, provide this info to the stranded pilot, and assist them in locating and gaining access to it.</p>

						<p>Please head over to our in-game public channel, "Eve-Scout", and ask for a Signal Cartel member to guide you to one of our rescue frigates. If there is one available in your current wormhole system, the process to follow to locate it in space is fairly straightforward:</p>
						<p><img src="../img/BounceMethod.jpg" width="900px" /></p>
						<ol>
							<li>Warp to 100 km off the planet (the "Align Planet").</li>
							<li>Warp to 100 km off the second planet (the "Rescue Cache Planet").</li>
							<li>During the warp, drop a temporary bookmark at ~100,000km to 50,000km of the Rescue Cache Planet and name it something like "T1". This initial bookmark is designed to reduce travel time and to gather a sense of bearing (speed, drop distance, etc.). Placement of this first bookmark is critical for reducing the number of bounces you will need to make. Here is a handy guideline to follow:<br />
								- 5AU/s ships: Submit BM when flying past 1,000,000 km to drop a BM around 40,000 km in space<br />
								- 3AU/s ships: Submit BM when flying between 100,000 and 200,000 km to drop a BM around 40,000 km in space</li>
							<li>When you leave warp, drop a second temporary bookmark and name it something like "T2". You just completed pass #1.</li>
							<li>Time to start pass #2. Warp back to T1 bookmark.</li>
							<li>During the warp, drop another temporary bookmark between T1 and T2. Name it "T3".</li>
							<li>When you arrive at T1, check the distance from the Rescue Cache Planet. Is the distance between 22,000 and 50,000 km? If it is, check d-scan for the frigate. If not, warp back to T3 and continue to next step.</li>
							<li>From T3, warp to T2. During the warp, drop a bookmark and name it "T4".</li>
							<li>When you arrive at T2, you have completed pass #2.</li>
							<li>Time to start pass #3. Warp to T4.</li>
							<li>Repeat steps 6-10, warping to the nearest temporary bookmark with each pass and gradually approaching the desired distance. As soon as you are between 22,000 and 50,000 km from the Rescue Cache Planet, check d-scan for the frigate. As soon as it appears on your overview, warp to it.</li>
							<li><strong>When you are finished using the cache, it would be very helpful if you could return all supplies to it for use by the next stranded pilot. Thank you!</strong>></li>

					<div class="panel-body">
						<p>The rescue frigate concept was created to address those pilots who cannot be helped by our rescue caches, namely, those pilots who do not have a probe launcher fit to their ship and/or do not have any way to fit one from within the wormhole. Thus, pilots who would not be helped by a resche cache, may be helped instead by a rescue frigate.</p>
						<p>Please note that rescue frigates are more expensive and more difficult to place than rescue caches. Therefore, they are relatively more rare in space. Every system that has a rescue frigate in place should also have a rescue cache, if that is of help to you.</p>

						<p>While we respect the inhabitants of every wormhole, it is not always possible to contact them prior to or after leaving a rescue frigate. The resources that we leave behind do not provide any actionable intel nor do we share information about our travels with any third parties. Additionally, our pilots are instructed to avoid placing rescue frigates within d-scan range of POSes or Citadels whenever possible. However, New Eden is a dangerous place and we cannot guarantee that our resources will not be untampered with. As in all scenarios, use caution when approaching a rescue frigate!</p>

						<p>Within Signal Cartel, each pilot is encouraged to participate in and invent ways to embody all that the Credo envisions. The Rescue Frigate program is merely one of the myriad ways our pilots strive to live up to that high calling.</p>
						<p>There are many reasons capsuleers fly in New Eden: glory, fame, riches. Our pilots do so to be a part of one of the greatest stories of our time. Our glory, our fame, our wealth is the magnificent narrative tapestry we are weaving together. One of our favorite corporate pastimes is sharing with one another stories of successful rescues that occur as the result of our various rescue programs.
